This maven-based project defines some Eclipse configuration files, which we used for years. 
Those are:

- PMD, Checkstyle and FindBug configuration for Java
- Java clean, formatter and codetemplates
- JavaScript formatter settings


The project was created as Java/Maven project for convenience purposes (can be used in maven plugins).
